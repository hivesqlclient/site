**HiveSQLClient**

https://hivesqlclient.github.io/site/

HiveSQLClient is a free graphical standalone Java program that will allow you to connect to Kerberised (Kerberos enabled) Hive Cluster for managing Hive objects. Most of the client applications require MIT Kerberos client which needs an additional step to log in and renew to obtain a new Kerberos ticket. A simple and lightweight program which doesn't require MIT Kerberos client to be installed on your machine and will get a Kerberos ticket automatically when you log in.
